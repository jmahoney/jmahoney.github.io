I maintain a short list of books that I call The Engineering Manager's bookshelf. I've just updated it with a new entry

### [Never Split The Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It by Chris Voss with Tahl Raz](https://bookshop.org/a/14808/9780062407801)

Chris Voss was an FBI negotiator and developed his skills and techniques by talking to kidnappers, hostage takers, employers, and car salesmen. I think the techniques in this book - calibrated questions, focusing on the issue, treating the people you're negotiating with as partners, observing how people act, building trust - are essential to having a successful career as manager, and to ensuring you and your team are set up for success.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
