I've heard the term gRPC used a lot but didn't really know what it meant. So I was happy to come across [this video discussing how CCP games employed gRPC to add stability and reliability to the server architecture that runs Eve Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR0YTEEMLFg). The potted history of Eve Online evolution was nice, too.
