[A new playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_) appeared on [Double Fine's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DoubleFineProd) recently: all 30+ episodes documenting seven years of work to make [Psychonauts 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/). The documentary is called [PsychOdyssey](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_)

I'm only a couple of episodes in, and it already has all the vibes of [Double Fine Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd7F6pU2ByRRb0igiI-WKk3D), a documentay I watch every 18 months or so.

Here's the blurb:

> 2 Player Productions and Double Fine Productions present Double Fine PsychOdyssey, an unprecedented documentary experience seven years in the making.
>
> Ten years after the release of their flagship video game Psychonauts, Double Fine Productions returns to its most celebrated franchise with Psychonauts 2.  Now facing the pressure to produce a worthy sequel, the studio must confront overly ambitious designs, poor morale, technical challenges and financial woes, all during a turbulent span of time for the world.
>
> Double Fine PsychOdyssey is the direct continuation of the acclaimed series Double Fine Adventure, and offers even deeper insight into the passion, humor, and heartbreak of video game development.
