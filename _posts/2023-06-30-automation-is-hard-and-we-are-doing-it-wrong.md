Johan Abildskov presented [Automation is Hard!](https://youtu.be/JU5niXIrK3Y) at GOTO Copenhagen in 2022 and it popped up in my feed while I was on the pro-leisure circuit. 

If you're on board with the practices discussed in the likes of [*The DevOps Handbook* and *Accelerate*](/engineering-manager-bookshelf) then it might be a little bit preaching to the choir, but if you're still figuring out how to improve the stability of your software and the speed at which you deploy it, this is a bloody good talk.

The blurb:

> Automation is a key part of any efficiency project and of being a successful software organization. But the way we as an industry approaches automation hinders our success and puts a stop in our track.
> 
> In this talk, I will cover some of the ways we set ourselves up for failure, as teams, orgs and engineers. Of course, you will also leave with a few sound practices to address the issues presented.
