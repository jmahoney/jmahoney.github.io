*[On-call at any size](https://increment.com/on-call/on-call-at-any-size/)* is a great primer for orgs thinking about upping their resilience and reliability game.  Will Larson's *[Incident response, programs, and you(r startup)](https://lethain.com/incident-response-programs-and-your-startup/)* is an essential companion piece.

>- yes, your home page must be an SPA
>- you can't live without a message queue
