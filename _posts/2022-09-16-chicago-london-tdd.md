title: Dave Farley describes the London and Chicago schools of Test Driven Development
permalink: /london-chicago-tdd

Did you know there are two schools of thought when it comes to Test Driven Development? I didn't until Dave Farley's video *[Are You Chicago or London When It Comes To TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S5iUf0ANyQ)* landed in my feed last week. The title piqued my interest and I was delighted to find a great discussion of approaches to TDD and how they complement each other.

If you're a seasoned test driven developer, or merely TDD-curious, this is a really good refresher.
