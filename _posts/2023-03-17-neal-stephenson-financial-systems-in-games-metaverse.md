Neal Stephenson's recent keynote at D.I.C.E is titled ["Games and the Open Metaverse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWdDHH-jFY0) and is retitled "Blah blah Metaverse blah blah blah" by Stephenson in the first five seconds. He goes on to talk about the different kinds of markets for things like books and video games, and why we feel icky when the intangible value for goods isn't part of the discussion. Stephenson talks about the value of ensuring that financialization of things like games needs to come out of the experience and quotes Rebecca Barkin on this point: "You can't architect a compelling experience backward from a desired financial outcome."
