[Brendan Leonard](https://semi-rad.com/) wrote [my favourite book on running](https://bookshop.org/a/14808/9781579659882) and this month his latest book [*Ultra-Something*](https://semi-rad.com/ultra/) was published. The book is about "the humans’ weird proclivity for endurance, and how we express it—including, but not limited to distance running, factory work, benign masochism, improv comedy, and rooting for football teams that will never win a championship." You can [read the first chapter here](https://semi-rad.com/2024/05/the-first-chapter-of-my-new-book-ultra-something/) or [watch the author read it](https://semi-rad.com/ultra/).
