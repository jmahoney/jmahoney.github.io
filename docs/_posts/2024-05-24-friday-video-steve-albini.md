RIP [Steve Albini](https://www.stereogum.com/2262790/steve-albini-final-interview/interviews/weve-got-a-file-on-you/) who [died unexpectedly this month](https://www.stereogum.com/2262785/steve-albini-dead-at-61/news/).

Albini engineered some of my favourite records. My vinyl collection isn't huge but Albini was involved with a large minority of them. 

There are so many videos I could point to, but [this short chat](https://youtu.be/VDw22kt9yUY) the late Anthony Bourdain is a good intro to the man and his approach to the world.
