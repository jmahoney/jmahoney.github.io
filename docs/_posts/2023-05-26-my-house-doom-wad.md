Do you have a couple of hours spare to [watch someone else play Doom II](https://youtu.be/5wAo54DHDY0)? This video is worth it.

A few weeks ago an [innocuous post on the Doomworld forums announced the release of MyHouse.wad](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134292-myhousewad/). Players expecting to find a basic 90s-style level of a suburban home instead found a conversion of the game that pushes the engine to its limits and creates an experience much more like the novel *[House of Leaves](https://bookshop.org/a/14808/9780375703768)* than your typical run and gun Doom experience.

There's something to be admired about the time, effort, and skill that goes into creating works of art like this with old-school tools.
