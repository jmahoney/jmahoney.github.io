Every Friday I post a video related to one of the themes of this site. This week it's [a talk about how to make big games](https://youtu.be/QOAW9ioWAvE).

At the D.I.C.E Summit in 2002 [Mark Cerny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cerny) presented his [Method for successful game development](https://youtu.be/QOAW9ioWAvE). Around the same time that the orignal signatories of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) documented the principles that they had discovered while making software, Cerny described something very similar and more concrete. He deliberately splits the pre-production and production processes of game development, because 1) they have two different outputs - a game design and then a game and 2) require different ways of working - pre-production is learning and prototyping, production is putting that learning into action. As Cerny puts it, production is easy, but pre-production is hard. Along the way Cerny busts many myths about development - planning, technology, milestones etc.

Twenty years later there is still a lot to learn from this talk.
