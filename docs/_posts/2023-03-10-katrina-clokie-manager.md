One thing about being a manager yourself is that you can tend to forget that you have a manager, and that you need to practice the advice you might give to your own reports. [This talk by Katrina Clokie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RknpWB0wRQ) is an excellent reminder of the value of maintaining a good working relationship with yours.

I was lucky enough to work and talk with Katrina for a couple of years and I'm so much the better for it. Katrina has a gift for framing things slightly differently than you'd expect, generally towards more effective outcomes and [*Making the most of your manager*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RknpWB0wRQ) is a great example: it's not about *managing up*, it's about what you can do to make sure you have an effective advocate in the workplace.
