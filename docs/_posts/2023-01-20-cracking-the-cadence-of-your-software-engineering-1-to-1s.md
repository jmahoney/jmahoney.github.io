As is the tradition for  New Zealand based managers are coming back from a summer break I'm looking at all of my practices and thinking about where I might be able to do better this year. This year I've landed on more effective 1:1s. I'm a fan of [LeadDev.com](https://leaddev.com) for topics like this and there are a [wealth of resources about 1:1s there](https://leaddev.com/category/11s).

One video that I found particularly useful was a pancel discussion titled: [Cracking the cadence of your software engineering 1:1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RlVUcCLNg)

The discussion is much more than just the scheduling (and every participant did something slightly different anyway)

* do your 1:1s weekly
* don't skip, reschedule
* have a shared notes page to help ensure you're both aligned on the takeaways and action items
* have a scorecard for yourself to assess the value and usefulness of your 1:1s
* some, maybe many people don't want to do 1:1s, you need to show the value - do that by paying attention and following up outside 1:1s
* consider a non-regular schedule, especially if you have people you talk to who take more energy than others
