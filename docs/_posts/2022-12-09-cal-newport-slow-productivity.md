title: Cal Newport on Slow Productivity

[Cal Newport's Deep Questions podcast](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/) was a new subscription for me this year. Newport covers a bunch of topics around the theme of doing important work well and sustainably. The podcast is way less dry than you might imagine, largely due to Newport's dad-joke heavy sense of humour.

I know diving into the latest ep of a podcast can sometimes feel like you've missed a trick, so for folks who are curious, [this video on Newport's views on they why and how of Slow Productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZwPyB20lxg) is a pretty good intro to his subject matter.
