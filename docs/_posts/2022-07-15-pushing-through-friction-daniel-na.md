title: Pushing Through Friction, a talk by Daniel Na
---

Every Friday I post a video related to one of the themes of this site. This week it's [a talk by Daniel Na about pushing through organisational friction to get important work done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bxZuzDKoI0).

What is organisational friction? Daniel's description says it best:

_As a senior-level engineering leader, experience tells you things could be better. You see the gaps. If only the company adopted policy A or dumped technology B, everyone would benefit. But there's so much inertia. The company has always used B. You are frustrated. Can you actually make a difference? Yes. You are encountering organizational friction, and learning to identify, accept and push through friction is a key skill of engineering leaders._
