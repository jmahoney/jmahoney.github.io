[Vicky Boykis looks back on two years and Automattic and Tumblr](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/07/25/looking-back-at-two-years-at-automattic-and-tumblr/)

> Making something work and run for other people is one of the greatest joys you can experience as an engineer. The second greatest joy is having Jenkins turn green on the first deploy.

> Sometimes you will have to explain the same thing to multiple people and sometimes to the same people in different ways, and sometimes, also, even to yourself in different ways. This is where writing and documentation helps a lot. It’s not just for others. It’s for you to clarify and explain your thoughts.

> In order to continue to grow as an engineer, you need to ship either systems that impact more people (wide), or systems that are tightly scoped but more complex (deep). There is no other way to grow.
