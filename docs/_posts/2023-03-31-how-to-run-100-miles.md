Brendan Leonard is a writer, journalist, runner, and outdoors enthusiast. His blog, [Semi-Rad](https://semi-rad.com/) is a source of joy and fun for me every week. In 2017 he made a short documentary for REI titled [*How To Run 100 Miles*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC7Lh4opLsc), which chonicles the build up to and running of 102.9 mile ultra-marathon, but also dives into *why* anyone would want to do such a horrible thing to themselves. It's an uplifting and entertaining film that might even get you to consider lacing up for a long run.

For my part, [tomorrow](https://www.parkrun.co.nz/waitangi/) begins a 10 month build up to the [Tarawera 50km Ultra](https://www.taraweraultra.co.nz/race-options/tum50/).
