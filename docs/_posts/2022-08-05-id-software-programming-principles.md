Every Friday I post a video related to one of the themes of this site. This week it's [John Romero at GDC Europe talking about the the programming principles of early id Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2MIpi8pIvY).

n the 1990s, during a hyper-prolific period where they released 28 games in less than five years, id Softwareâ€™s policy for bugs was to drop everything and fix them as soon as possible. The result was [a track record of games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_id_Software_games) that were technically innovative, genre defining, and of undeniably high quality.

In this 2016 talk John Romero discusses the 11 principles that contributed to that remarkable run:

1. No prototypes - the code is the game so polish now and maintain quality
2. Fallbacks on load failure - keep the game runnable and resilient to errors
3. Simplify - remove complexity wherever you can
4. Focus on tools - spend time making tools good as they help make a great game
5. Don't rely on testers - as in test your stuff yourself and don't waste people's time on buggy code
6. Fix bugs immediately - fix bugs so they don't cause more bugs
7. Target less powerful systems - your dev computer should able to make your game fly
8. Don't write code for future projects - You'll write better code when you need it
9. Write modular code - encapsulation aids good design
10. Code transparently - talk about how you're going to solve your problem and ask for feedback
11. Embrace differences in programmers - the output matters more than minor differences in coding styles
