Last night I took a dive into the Tony Stark "conversational programming" future and asked my computer to build a page that collects the Youtube videos I've links and plunks them randomly in a playlist that you can put on in the background for what must be close to a day and a half of viewing.  It took about 10 minutes with a little back and forth.

Today I updated the metadata on three dozen posts and pushed it up. The result is [Iterative TV](/tv). I'm gonna chuck it on in the background and see what happens.
