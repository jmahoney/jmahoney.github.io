Every Friday I post a video related to one of the themes of this site. This week it's [a dive into the how the first edition of the legendary Civilization series of games was made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ-auWfJTts).

Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley talk about how they made Civilization, including design decisions, technical trade-offs, and why the game's version of Ghandi had such a bad temper.
