[This clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j71n33A0CkI) popped up in my Youtube feed and piqued my interest. A snippet of [a longer conversation between Dave Farley and Michael Feathers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGD8pMMJlbk&t=0s), in this clip Michael Feathers talks about how OOP and FP can look quite similar, and goes on to talk about the "surface area" of tests and how that relates to the traditional OO concept of separation of concerns. It's a nice and nerdy 10 minutes.
