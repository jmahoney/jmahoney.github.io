Charles Stross: [On mistaking a transient state for a permanent one](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2024/05/on-mistaking-a-transient-state.html)

>Astronomers were the first to notice, as Starlink streaks made a mess for ground based telescopes to peer through. But the next issue is metal polution, as re-entering satellites melt and mostly vapourize in the upper atmosphere. 45,000 Starlink 2 satellites would weigh 90,000 tonnes, and with a 10 year life (never mind the 3-5 year current lifespan) they'd be dumping nearly ten thousand tonnes of metal into the upper stratosphere every year, which is probably a Bad Thing and is rightly generating alarm among environmentalists and climate researchers.

>However.

>Dumping 9000 tons of metal into the upper atmosphere is a linear extrapolation from today's situation, and does not reflect what's ultimately going to happen. This is a transient phase—the gold rush, the railroad race—and not the steady state we're going to end up in once the period of rapid expansion comes to an end.


I've been enjoying [Dr Katie Mack & John Green's podcast about the history of the universe](https://crash-course-pods-the-universe.simplecast.com/). They are three episodes in and have finally got to a timescale beyond the first few seconds. It't fantastic. Here's [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5YO9nmojo4):
