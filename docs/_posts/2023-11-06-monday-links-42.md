*The thing nobody talks about with engineering management is this:

Every 3-4 months every person experiences some sort of personal crisis. A family member dies, they have a bad illness, they get into an argument with another person at work, etc. etc. Sadly, that is just life. Normally after a month or so things settle down and life goes on.

But when you are managing 6+ people it means there is *always* a crisis you are helping someone work through. You are always carrying a bit of emotional burden or worry around with you.*

[Cert NZ's Cyber Smart concentrated on awareness of online scams](https://www.ownyouronline.govt.nz/exposed/). It's worth sharing this site with friends and family.
