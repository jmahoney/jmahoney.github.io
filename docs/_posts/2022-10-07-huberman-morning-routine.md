Programmers are at their best when they can focus deeply on a task. Managers thrive when they have the energy to context switch. A good sleep and an efficient morning routine help a lot in both cases.

[Andrew Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com) is a professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. [In this chat with Jocko Willink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_f-iwUGY4), Huberman discusses what happens in your body when you sleep and wake, and talks about practices that can help set you up for a day of good work.

Among Huberman's tips:

* Aim to have a good sleep 80% of the time
* Get natural light in your eyes within an hour of waking up
* Excercise early
* Try cold water to raise your body temperature
* Delay your intake of caffeine by 90 minutes
