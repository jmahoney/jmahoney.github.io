🚀 [NZ Tech Rally](https://nztechrally.com/) is a new developer community [founded by Wellington-based developers](https://nztechrally.com/about/), including fellow Xero [Prae Songprasit](https://praesongprasit.com/). Their first event is in-person conference centrered around software engineering being held in early July. The theme is *What does great software engineering culture look like, and how have kiwis done it?*. 

I've had a small glimpse into the work involved to get the conference off the ground and my hat is off to the team. It's going to be great. I've [purchased my early bird ticket](https://nztechrally2023.lilregie.com/booking/attendees/new) and I'm looking forward to [talks by Adam Howard, Jenny Sangh, and Katrina Clokie](https://nztechrally.com/schedule/).

> You can find a reason to stay at work all night, every night here. There is always going to be something to do. You are never going to clear out your inbox. You are never going to return every phone call. You are never going to read every paper that you could. Ultimately if you do that, you’ll be worse at your job. 

This short article reminded me about the key lessons of *Four Thousand Hours* and *Getting Things Done*: there is too much to do, so knowing what you can not do, and actually not doing it, is really important.
