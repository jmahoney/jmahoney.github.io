[Speaking at RubyConf Mini 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPmFQSI0lo), Jenny Shih walks through the powerful mental models and tools that FP gives us, and how we can readily use them to improve our apps in a language that we all love and understand.

I think this is only the second talk ever that I've actually come away thinking I understand everything the speaker wanted to say about Functional Programming.
