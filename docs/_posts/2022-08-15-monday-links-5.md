[The SPACE of Developer Productivity](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124) by Dr Nicole Forsgren, Dr Margaret Anne-Storey, and researchers from Microsoft.

> This article explicates several common myths and misconceptions about developer productivity. The most important takeaway from exposing these myths is that productivity cannot be reduced to a single dimension (or metric!). The prevalence of these myths and the need to bust them motivated our work to develop a practical multidimensional framework, because only by examining a constellation of metrics in tension can we understand and influence developer productivity. This framework, called SPACE, captures the most important dimensions of developer productivity: satisfaction and well-being; performance; activity; communication and collaboration; and efficiency and flow. By recognizing and measuring productivity with more than just a single dimension, teams and organizations can better understand how people and teams work, and they can make better decisions.

> Most approaches to instrumenting time allocation require a large time investment from your team to track tasks, which somewhat defeats the plan goal to save their time. One approach I found to work very well, without requiring major workflow changes by your team, is creating a simple internal website that contains your teamâ€™s service cookbook.
