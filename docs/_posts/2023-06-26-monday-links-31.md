[Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs#introduction) is "a configuration framework for GNU Emacs tailored for Emacs bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks, a modicum of stability (and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of a hand rolled config (or better)." Why it's named Doom [is explained in the FAQ](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs#introduction):

> As a kid in the Cretaceous period (1999), the source code of idsoftware’s classic Doom was my first exposure to programming. Totally clueless about C and compilers, all I could do was peek at it from time to time and hope I’d absorb its secrets if I stared hard enough. It didn’t work, but it sure jump-started by gamedev addiction.
> 
> So “Doom Emacs” was what you got when you combined childhood, demon-carnage nostalgia, terrible naming sense, and the sneaking suspicion that Emacs is the unwritten tenth circle Dante censored for humanity’s protection.
