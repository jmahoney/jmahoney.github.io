Linters and codeformatters are my favourite kinds of tool because they promote consistency, uncover complexity, and save teams from nonsense issues.

The other thing about a linter is that it seems like one of those problems that *seems* easy on the surface but has a potentially huge amount of complexity as soon as you think about it. [This RubyConf by Kyle d'Oliveira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSCMgcttW4c) discusses [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop), the most popular linter for Ruby.

Kyle briefly talks about how his organisation uses RuboCop, then does a short dive into how RuboCop implements its rules using abstract syntax trees, depth first searching, and other techniques. This talk is perfect if you feel like diving deep, just for a little bit.
