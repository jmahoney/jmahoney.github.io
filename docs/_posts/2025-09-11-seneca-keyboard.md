[The Seneca: First Edition](https://www.norbauer.co/products/the-seneca) mechanical keyboard by Norbauer & Co starts at USD$3,600 and there is a 6-9 month waitlist to get one. It's the first midlife crisis purchase that I could seriously get behind.

The Seneca is the product of one industrial designer's obsession to build the perfect keyboard. One that looks, sounds, and feels *exactly* how Ryan Norbauer wants a keyboard to be. 

In this Friday Video [Adam Savage visits Norbauer and they dive deep into space bar stabilisers](https://youtu.be/N3FEv1qw4_w). And by deep, I mean way further into the rabbit hole that you'd think possible. It's a wonderful interview.

And I really want one of those keyboards.
