[In April I posted about finishing up at Xero after almost ten years](https://iterative.co.nz/open-to-work-april-2023). At the time I expected to be on [the pro-leisure circuit](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-one-about-the-pro-leisure-circuit/) for at least three months, but I came across an intriguing role at [The Co-operative Bank](https://www.co-operativebank.co.nz/), and I've been the Head of Development, Testing & Security for the last four weeks. 

Honestly, it has been a bit of a whirlwind. There is much to learn about the bank, the people, banking in general, and challenges of building software keeps customers and their data safe but also easily allows them to access and manage the banks services. I'm having a gret time.
