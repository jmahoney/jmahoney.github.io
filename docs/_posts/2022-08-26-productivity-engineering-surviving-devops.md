Modern software engineering is changed from when I were a lad. The compile it, test it, and throw it over the wall to ops lifecycle is a thing of the past. Dev teams own their code from soup to nuts, have many more tools at their disposal,  and much more autonomy in how they build and manage things. Yay!

With all this power comes complexity, inconsistency, and a heavier "cognitive load" on development teams. Boo!

[This talk by Mike McGarr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmbavBi_SLY) addresses those challenges in more depth and discusses how Netflix organise to meet the challenges. Like many talks about how Netflix works, the principles and patterns here are useful food for thought for any company that has a lot of software.
