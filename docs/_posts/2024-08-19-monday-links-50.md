[Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/) continues to be a wealth of interesting posts. Recently:

* [The Door Problem](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/18/the-door-problem/)
* [Links and materials for *Living off Microsoft Copilot*](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/14/living-off-microsoft-copilot/)
* [Matt Webb's Braggoscope Prompts](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/7/braggoscope-prompts/)

If you're remotely interested in how modern programming is developing, including serious consideration of the bad bits, then Simon is a must-read.
