Understanding how your systems *actually* work is an important part of software engineering. More often than not when something goes wrong it's due to an incorrect assumption about the software or the environment in which it runs. And, man, [are there a lot of things people *just believe* to be true](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood).

This talk isn't about software engineering, but it's a good illustration of how having an accurate understanding about how something actually works can change how you think about it.

In this TEDx talk [Ruben Meerman](https://rubenmeerman.com/) poses the question: [when you lose weight, where does the fat go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIlsN32WaE) He proceeds to dispel some falsehoods about fat loss, and dives into the chemistry of the process. It's a fascinating and entertaining watch.
